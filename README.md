# Compiling the Project with Make

This guide demonstrates how to compile the *Search* project using the Make utility. 
Follow the steps below to compile and run the project successfully.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- GCC (GNU C Compiler)
- Make

## Compilation

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project's root directory using the cd command:

	```
	cd /path/to/project/directory/Search
	```

3. Execute the make command to compile the project:

	```
	make
	```

This command will compile the project and generate the executable file.

4. To clean the generated object files and the executable, you can run:

	```
	make clean
	```

This will remove all compiled object files (\*.o) and the Search executable.

5. To run the compiled program, use the following command:

	```
	./Search
	```
#   S e a r c h
